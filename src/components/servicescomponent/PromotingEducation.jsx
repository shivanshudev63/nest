                NEST attempts to examine and understand the low literacy level
                and education among tribal children in Jharkhand. We understand
                the linkages between education and development. Various
                programmes and schemes have been initiated but very few of them
                have reached the tribal children and benefited them. Many of the
                programmes did not benefit the tribal community because the
                programmes were not contextualized and localized considering
                regional, geographical and physical differences and barriers.
                Other reasons for not reaching the benefits of the programs to
                the tribals are lack of political will, corruption, and lesser
                attention on development in tribal areas. NEST Programs
                highlights the need for special focus on tribal education, which
                is inclusive of context specific traditional and innovative
                interventions.
