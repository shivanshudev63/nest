              <p>
                The history of sports extends back to the Ancient world. The
                physical activity that developed into sports had early links
                with ritual, warfare and entertainment. As far back as the
                beginnings of sport, it was related to military training. For
                example, competition was used as a mean to determine whether
                individuals were fit and useful for service. Team sports were
                used to train and to prove the capability to fight in the
                military and also to work together as a team (military unit).

              <p>
                Military sports are sports practiced by the military. They are
                the subject of international competitions, such as the Military
                World Games, with an objective relating to the physical training
                of military. Particular sports may be chosen to improve combat
                readiness, skill, toughness, the development of physical
                qualities of the warfighter, and professional proficiency based
                on the different areas of the military action: land, sea and
                air.

              <p>
                Precursors to chess originated in India. There, its early form
                in the 7th century CE was known as chaturaṅga, which translates
                to “four divisions (of the military)”: infantry, cavalry,
                elephantry, and chariotry. These forms are represented by the
                pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop,
                and rook, respectively.

                A single, unambiguous aim is the keystone of a successful
                military operation, or action on the chessboard. Selection and
                maintenance of the aim is regarded as the master principle of
                warfare. The ultimate aim of a game of chess is to give
                checkmate to the opponent’s king.

                From ancient India to the computer age, the military has used
                chess as both a metaphor and even as training for warfare. But
                as Dominic Lawson writes, generals who compare themselves with
                grandmasters are exaggerating their control of human combat.

              <p>
                Shooting sports is a group of competitive and recreational
                sporting activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy,
                precision and speed in shooting — the art of using ranged
                firearms, mainly referring to man-portable guns (firearms and
                airguns, in forms such as handguns, rifles and shotguns) and
                bows/crossbows. Shooting sports can be categorized by equipment,
                shooting distances, targets, time limits and degrees of
                athleticism involved. Shooting sports may involve both team and
                individual competition, and team performance is usually assessed
                by summing the scores of the individual team members. Due to the
                noise of shooting and the high (and often lethal) impact energy
                of the projectiles, shooting sports are typically conducted at
                either designated permanent shooting ranges or temporary
                shooting fields in the area away from settlements.

                <strong>NEST IS ALSO PROMOTING PARALYMPIC SHOOTING !</strong>
              </h5>

                Paralympic shooting, also known as shooting Para sport, is an
                adaptation of shooting sports for competitors with disabilities.
                Shooting is a test of accuracy and control, in which competitors
                use pistols or rifles to fire a series of shots at a stationary
                target. Each shot is worth a maximum score of 10.9 points.
                Athletes use .22 caliber rifles, pistols and .177 caliber air
                guns (compressed air or pneumatic). Paralympic shooting first
                appeared in the Summer Paralympics at the 1976 Toronto Games.
                Competitions are open to all athletes with a physical
                disability. Shooting utilizes a functional classification
                system, which enables wheelchair users and ambulant athletes
                from different disability classes to compete together either
                individually or in teams.
