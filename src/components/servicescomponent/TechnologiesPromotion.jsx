                By his early 20s, he had already invented electrical bicycle
                contraptions, a station indicator for Bombay’s suburban railway
                system, tamper-proof bottles and a cutting-edge grocery weighing

                However, Bhisey is most recognised for his iconic Bhisotype, a
                type-casting machine that revolutionised the printing industry.
                In one minute, the machine could cast and assemble 1200
                different types automatically. When top researchers from Britain
                contested his claim, he went ahead to set up his own foundry and
                showcase his machine to the critics who were left spellbound by
                his technical prowess.

                Throughout his career, Bhisey had 200 inventions and 40 patents
                to his name, which include a unique telephone model, kitchen
                appliances, automatic toilet flushers and even an early
                prototype of a push-up bra. Bhisey later upgraded the Bhisotype
                to comprise finer features and faster performance, however, the
                funding for his continued research was compromised with the
                advent of World War I, after which he gradually faded into
                oblivion. He passed away on 7 April 1935, in New York at the age
                of 68.

                fascinated by it, that he left home, worked as a waiter for

                Mani was born in 1918 to an affluent family, and displayed

Thus, suppressing the pest & other gram-ve colonies & enhances health of local ecology.
