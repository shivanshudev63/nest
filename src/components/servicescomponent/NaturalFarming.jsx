                Subash Palekar (Indian Agriculturist and Padma Shri Recipient)
                is the father of Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF). He
                developed it in the mid-1990s as an alternative to the Green
                Revolution methods.The points put-forward by Subash Palekar in
                support of Zero Budget Natural Farming are:Lakhs of farmers are
                using the technique of Zero Budget Natural Farming in different
                agro-climatic zones and soil types. To grow a plant, whatever is
                needed is present in nature. No chemicals are required to grow a
                plant. An example – Earthworm excreta has seven times more
                nitrogen than the soil. Large number of small farmers are using
                this technique as they see Zero Budget Natural Farming as a tool
                that can free them from debts and defaults. It makes farming
                both profitable and sustainable.
