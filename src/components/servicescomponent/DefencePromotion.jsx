                Between 1221 and 1327, the Mongol Empire made several incursions
                into India. The Mongols first appeared in the Indus River in
                1221 when Genghis Khan pursued Sultan Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu to
                Ghazni. He joined forces with the local armies and successfully
                managed to keep the Mongolians from gaining more land in India.
                However, Genghis Khan regrouped his forces and defeated the
                sultan before invading several empires in the subcontinent. In
                1235, the Mongols captured Kashmir and stationed an
                administrative governor in the city. Shortly after, the Mongols
                captured Peshawar and Lahore.

                The Romans were the first Europeans to reach India, but the
                collapse of the Empire led to the rise of other empires in the
                Indian subcontinent. In 1498, the Ottoman Empire closed the
                route to the Far East forcing the Portuguese to seek an
                alternative way. The Portuguese sailed around Africa and landed
                in present-day Kerala. They established a trade route across
                India until the Dutch arrived and established the Dutch East
                India Company. The French and the British subsequently developed
                trading bases in the continent. In 1858, the British formally
                declared India its colony by establishing the British Raj. The
                Raj was a response by the British after the Indian Rebellion of
                1857. The British colonized India until 1947 when they
                partitioned the colony into the present-day states of India and
                Pakistan.

                Historically, the IAF has generally relied on Soviet, British,
                Israeli and French military craft and technology to support its
                growth. IAF’s primary air superiority fighter with the
                additional capability to conduct air-ground (strike) missions is
                Sukhoi Su-30MKI. The IAF have placed an order for a total of 272
                Su-30MKIs of which 205 are in service as of May 2015. The
                Mikoyan MiG-29 is a dedicated air superiority fighter, and
                constitutes a second line of defence after the Sukhoi Su-30MKI.
                At present, 66 MiG-29s are in service, all of which are being
                upgraded to the MiG-29UPG standard. The Dassault Mirage 2000 is
                the primary multirole fighter in service and the IAF operates 49
                Mirage 2000Hs which are being upgraded to the Mirage 2000-5 MK2

                The proposed design of the second carrier class will be a new
                design, featuring significant changes from Vikrant, including an
                increase in size and displacement. An Electromagnetic Aircraft
                Launch System (EMALS) CATOBAR system is also under
                consideration.[8] Its name Vishal means ‘giant’ in Sanskrit.

                According to the report, the Surya is an intercontinental-range,

                The report further adds that Surya is the most ambitious project
                in India’s Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. The
                surya missile is more of strategic in nature due to its
                capabilities and thus gives enemy mutually assured destruction.
                The Surya is speculated to have a range of more than 12,000
                kilometres, which brings almost all major nations of the world
                in its range. It is to be a three-stage design, with the first
                two stages using solid propellants and the third-stage using
                liquid. The first stage is speculated to be borrowed from Polar
                Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).

                upcoming main battle tank developed by DRDO for the Indian Army.
                The FMBT is designed to be considerably lighter than Arjun
                variants, planned to be equipped with advanced electro-optical
                sight systems and possibly a high power laser-based weapon
                system in addition to the main gun.The type and calibre of the
                main gun has not been decided yet but according to the DRDO the
                FMBT will have a main gun capable of firing high velocity
                projectiles at a longer distance. The FMBT will also have
                network-centric warfare capabilities.{" "}

                <strong>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                India has been in possession of nuclear weapons since 1974. Its
                most recent nuclear test took place on 11 May 1998, when
                Operation Shakti (Pokhran-II) was initiated with the detonation
                of one fusion and three fission bombs. On 13 May 1998, two
                additional fission devices were detonated. However, India
                maintains a “no-first use” and a nuclear deterrence policy
                against nuclear adversaries.Its nuclear doctrine envisages
                building a credible minimum deterrent for maintaining a “second
                strike capability” which would be massive and designed to induce
                unacceptable damage on the enemy.] India is one of only four
                nations in the world to possess a Nuclear triad. India’s nuclear
                missiles include the Prithvi, the Agni the Shaurya, the
                Sagarika, the Dhanush, and others. India conducted its first
                test with the Agni-V in April 2012 and a second test in
                September 2013. With its 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi) range, it
                can carry a nuclear warhead to the east to include all of China,
                and to the west deep into Europe. Agni-VI, with a perceived
                range of 6,000–8,000 kilometres (3,700–5,000 mi) is also under
                development with features like multiple independently targetable
                re-entry warheads (MIRVs).

              <p>
                The vast majority of soldiers in Indian Army are enlisted
                personnel, called by the Army as Soldier, general duty. These
                soldiers are recruited at different recruitment rallies across
                the country. At these rallies, Army recruiters look at
                candidates from surrounding districts and examine their fitness
                for the Army. Candidates for Soldier, general duty must have
                Class 10 Leaving Certificate and in the range of 17 to 21 years.
                The Army also does online applications to appear at recruitment
                rallies. Requirements for technical roles, like nurses,
                artillery, Missile Defense have more stringent educational
                requirements. The least restrictive job in Army is House Keeper
                and Cleaner, for which candidates only have to be 8th pass. At
                the rally, prospective soldiers are evaluated for height,
                weight, vision and hearing, and physical fitness. Fitness tests
                include a 1.6 km Run, Pull Ups, jumping a 9 Feet ditch, and
                doing a zig zag balance test. After recruitment rally, accepted
                candidates go to Basic Training.The Indian Armed Forces have set
                up numerous military academies across India for training
                personnel. Military schools, Sainik Schools, and the Rashtriya
                Indian Military College were founded to broaden the recruitment
                base of the Defence Forces. The three branches of the Indian

                decoration, awarded for displaying distinguished acts of valour
                during wartime.Param Vir Chakra translates as the “Wheel of the
                Ultimate Brave”, and the award is granted for “most conspicuous
                bravery in the presence of the enemy”. As of January 2018, the
                medal has been awarded 21 times, of which 14 were posthumous and
                16 arose from actions in Indo-Pakistani conflicts. Of the 21
                awardees, 20 have been from the Indian Army, and one has been
                from the Indian Air Force. Major Somnath Sharma, was the first
                recipient. A number of state governments of India as well as
                ministries of the central government provide allowances and
                rewards to recipients of the PVC (or their family members in
                case of the recipient’s death).
