                Today’s food and agricultural systems have succeeded in
                supplying large volumes of food to global markets. However,
                high-external input, resource-intensive agricultural systems
                have caused massive deforestation, water scarcities,
                biodiversity loss, soil depletion and high levels of greenhouse
                gas emissions. Despite significant progress in recent times,
                hunger and extreme poverty persist as critical global
                challenges. Even where poverty has been reduced, pervasive
                inequalities remain, hindering poverty eradication. Integral to
                FAO’s Common Vision for Sustainable Food and Agriculture,
                Agro-ecology is a key part of the global response to this
                climate of instability, offering a unique approach to meeting
                significant increases in our food needs of the future while
                ensuring no one is left behind.

                Agro-ecology is an integrated approach that simultaneously
                applies ecological and social concepts and principles to the
                design and management of food and agricultural systems. It seeks
                to optimize the interactions between plants, animals, humans and
                the environment while taking into consideration the social
                aspects that need to be addressed for a sustainable and fair
                food system.

                Agro-ecology is not a new invention. It can be identified in
                scientific literature since the 1920s, and has found expression
                in family farmers’ practices, in grassroots social movements for
                sustainability and the public policies of various countries
                around the world. More recently, agro-ecology has entered the
                discourse of international and UN institutions.

                In a context of a changing climate and growing concerns for more
                healthy food systems, agro ecology is gaining momentum as a
                scientific discipline, sustainable farming approach and social
                movement. There is growing anecdotal and case study evidence of
                its multiple benefits, from climate resilience to farm
                productivity. Yet its promotion in public agricultural policies,
                research and extension is still limited.

                It calls for consolidating the evidence base for agro ecology
                through multi-dimensional tools that not only measure yields,
                but also its many other benefits. Economic, Environmental and
                Social. Mainstreaming agro ecology will require a fundamental
                cultural and philosophical shift in how we as a society define
                ‘productive’ and ‘efficient’ agriculture.
