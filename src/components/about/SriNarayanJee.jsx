      <span>Sri Narayan Jee Started Organization Adim Jati Sewa Mandal.</span>
        <p>
          Adim Jati Sewa Mandal is one of oldest organization of undivided
          stated of Bihar. Great leaders of the country like Mahatma Gandhi, Dr.
          Rajendra Prasad, Shri A.V. Thakkar, Shri Govind Ballabh Path and
          others had assembled at Ramgarh (Now a District at Jharkhand) in the
          year 1939 for the annual session of all India Congress committee.
          During that period they came in contact with Adivasis of the region
          and were impressed by their patriotism, devotion to duty, sense of
          sacrifice and simplicity. However, their primitive way of living got
          them disturbed and they felt the necessity to work for them to improve
          their economic social and cultural condition to come out of the
          primitive way of living. Having the above view in mind, a social
          service center was established at district Gumla; in the year 1940
          under the leadership of Dr. Rajendra Prasad. Shri Narayan jee was the
          first person to offer his full time service to this center and the
          center started its activities by opening a few primary schools and
          Khadi Production Center with the help of some devoted workers like
          Shri Anirudh Prasad Singh, Shri Dhanush Prasad Singh, Shri Champa
          Bhagat, Shri Mahli Bhagat, Shri Ganpatilal Khandelwal, Shri Ganga
          Maharaj etc. Soon after i.e. in the year 1942, “Quit India Movement”
          for the independence took its final shape, in which all the leaders
          and many active workers of the country participated in the movement
          including Shri Narayan Jee were put behind the bars. Thus the work of
          the center, virtually, came to stand still. They were released only in
          the year 1945 they again rushed to their respective places.
          Accordingly, all of them assembled at Gumla to work out their future
          plan. Consequently, Gumla was selected as the heaquarter and a village
          named “Phori” was selected as the place of work where a Khadi
          production center was established and a sale center was established at
          Gumla under the administrative control of Shri Anirudh Prasad Singh.
          It was a very crucial period for these workers as they had lost all
          sources of their livelihood, because of the stoppage of the financial
          help from Gandh Sewa Sangh run by Mahatma Gandhi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to above reasons, all workers under the leadership of Shri Narayan
          jee decided to yoke out their livelihood by doing agriculture work at
          village “Phori”, where Shri Narayajee had purchased some land out of
          his own resources. Shri A.V.Thakkar popularly known as “Thakkar
          Bappaa” and Dr. Rajendra Prasad had given their all out support the
          endeavor of the workers. As a result of worker’s efforts, the Khadi
          Production center was fully established. The Tribal folk were fully
          engaged in the pursuit of the economic development. They started
          spinning with handmade “Charkha” and the yarn used to be knitted at
          Phori Ashram to be converted into clothes. These clothes used at sale
          center at Gumla.
        </p>
        <span>
          A large number of night schools were also started side by side to
          spread literacy among the tribals.
        </span>
        <p>
          Combined endeavor of workers gained them popularity among the Tribals
          of the area, which resulted in the success of Shri Nagar Mal Modi in
          the first assembly election for forming interim government in the year
          1946. In the year 1948, center’s head quarter was shifted to Ranchi
          and the center was named as Adim Jati Sewa Mandal. It was also
          registered under Societies Registration Act, 1860 in the year 1947.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, the Sewa Mandal is working continuously for the upliftment
          of adivasis and under-privileged members of the society. It also
          motivated innocent adivasis to avoid conversion of their religion. As
          mentioned earlier, Sewa Mandal’s activities, in the beginning, are
          confined mainly to impart education to children and production of
          Khadi and sale. This continued for a long time and by the year
          1972-73, it had nearly 500 (Five hundred) centers – Primary and
          Secondary High Schools, residential Schools Teachers Training Schools
          and Hostels both boys and girls- catering to the needs of about 20000
          (twenty thousand) students. The efforts made through Sewa Mandal
          during the last 26 – 27 years had a miraculous affect on adivasis of
          the region. Their primitive way of living changed to a great extent.
          They began cultivating land and livelihood. They even became conscious
          of their rights and responsibilities and many of them entered in
          government services. Leaders of earlier generation had passed away by
          then. Some of the politicians of the younger generation also
          co-operated with missionaries and finally in the year 1975, all the
          educational institutions of Sewa Mandal were taken over by the State
          Government in their direct control and grants given by them for the
          purpose were stopped. Thus, the activities of Sewa Mandal, relating to
          imparting of education came to a close for the time being. However,
          other activities of Sewa Mandal, like Khadi Production and its sale,
          Sewing class for girls Home for destitute etc. continued.
